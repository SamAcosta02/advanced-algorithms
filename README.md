# Advanced Algorithms
Developed and implemented advanced algorithms in C++ as part of a college project, focusing on graph theory, optimization, and computational geometry.

Algorithms implemented:
* <strong>Kruskal’s Algorithm:</strong> For minimum spanning trees.
* <strong>Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):</strong> Applied heuristic techniques for optimization.
* <strong>Dinic’s Algorithm:</strong> Solved maximum flow problems.
* <strong>Voronoi Diagram with Delaunay Triangulation:</strong> Built custom Point, Segment, and Polygon classes to create geometric primitives and methods like distance calculations and circumcircle construction.

Team members:
* Samuel Acosta Ugarte
* Diego Esparza Hurtado
* Alejandro Lizárraga Vizcarra
